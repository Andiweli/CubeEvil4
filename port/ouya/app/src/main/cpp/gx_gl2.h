// The GX renderer of the OUYA app (stage O2 of port/docs/ouya-machbarkeit.md): executes the
// chunks the game core's emulated graphics processor decodes (port/whole/runtime/re4_gx_frame.h)
// with OpenGL ES 2.0, as the OUYA's Tegra 3 offers it. It is the main app's GLES 3 renderer
// (port/android-decomp/app/src/main/cpp/gx_gl.cpp) rebuilt for GLES 2; the main app keeps its
// own, this one is a copy (decision of the project owner, 22.10.2026).
//
// Like the GLES 3 renderer it keeps the register state the chunks change (BP, XF, the palette
// part of TMEM), draws into its own embedded frame buffer (EFB, 640x528, colour and depth), turns
// EFB copies into textures (GXCopyTex) and display copies into the picture to show (GXCopyDisp,
// the XFB), and generates its shaders from the state (gx_gl2_shader.cpp). It reads both vertex
// forms: the float vertex and the compact one (RE4_GX_V_COMPACT: the GX types as the game sent
// them, scaled in the vertex shader), which the core writes for the OUYA (RE4_GX_COMPACT=1).
//
// Left out against the GLES 3 renderer: multisampling, the gameplay autofocus (depth of field),
// the uniform stream, GPU timers and fences, program binaries (the Tegra 3 has none), base
// vertices. What the Tegra 3 lacks besides (measured, port/scripts/ouya-gpu-info.ps1,
// 22.10.2026): 16-bit depth only, no depth textures (depth copies read the depth back with
// NV_read_depth, or are lost), non-power-of-two textures only clamped, mipmaps only complete
// (the levels a GX texture leaves out are made here), 9 varying vec4, 252 vertex vec4, fp20 in
// fragment shaders.
//
// Orientation as in the GLES 3 renderer: the EFB keeps GameCube rows (row 0 = top) at GL row 0;
// Present flips the XFB.
