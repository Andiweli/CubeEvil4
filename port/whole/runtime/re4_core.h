/* Embedding interface of the game core (libre4_main): what the Android app
 * (RE4-Android-Decomp, core mode) calls through dlsym, and what the Linux
 * checks (re4_host --core-test) call directly. Plain C and fixed-width types
 * only: the app is compiled separately and must not see game headers.
 *
 * Startup order (the app's JNI_OnLoad, before any GL work):
 *   re4_core_reserve(data, modules)   MEM1 at 0x80000000, folders, address check
 *   re4_core_start()                  the game in its own thread
 * Every frame (any thread):
 *   re4_core_pad(&pad)                controller channel 0
 *   re4_core_rumble()                 its rumble motor
 * The app's audio thread:
 *   re4_core_audio(out, frames)       the sound, 32 kHz stereo
 *   s = re4_core_acquire() ... re4_core_release(s)
 *                                     the newest published game frame
 * The game publishes one snapshot per game frame (PADRead), so a reader never
 * sees a half-written frame; the matrices are the parts' world matrices
 * (cParts::mat after partsWorldCalc), the camera is pG->Camera.param. */
