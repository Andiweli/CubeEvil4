/* What the emulated GameCube graphics processor hands to a renderer
 * (port/docs/gx-plan.md, step G2). Plain C and fixed-width types: the app's
 * GLES3 backend (G3) is compiled separately and never sees game headers.
 *
 * The core decodes the game's GX command stream (runtime/gx_decode.cpp) on
 * its own thread, at once, and resolves everything that lives in game
 * memory: vertex arrays and display lists become vertices and indices,
 * matrices loaded by index become XF writes, textures and palettes are copied
 * out. A renderer never reads game memory.
 *
 * The work is cut into chunks: one chunk ends with each display copy
 * (GXCopyDisp, BP 0x52 with bit 14), i.e. one game frame. Chunks are a
 * stream: each continues the register state of the one before (the BP, XF
 * and TMEM writes it contains are changes). A chunk with
 * RE4_GX_CHUNK_RESET starts over: it begins with the full state, and every
 * texture the renderer kept may be dropped (the core sends again what it
 * uses). Chunks are queued in order; the core waits while the queue is full
 * and the renderer takes chunks (a slow renderer slows the game down, as a
 * slow graphics processor would); a renderer that stops taking chunks for a
 * second loses the queue and gets a RESET chunk next.
 *
 *   const Re4GxChunk* c;
 *   while ((c = re4_core_gx_acquire()) != NULL) { run(c); re4_core_gx_release(c); }
 *
 * Before the first acquire no chunks are built (the decoder only keeps the
 * state); re4_core_gx_detach() returns to that. */
