/* The GX FIFO of the port (runtime/gx_fifo.cpp).
 *
 * On the GameCube every GX command goes through one write address, the
 * write-gather pipe at 0xCC008000 (GXWGFifo): the GX library and the game's
 * inline vertex functions store bytes, halfwords, words and floats there.
 * whole_prepare.py rewrites each such store (`GXWGFifo.T = x`,
 * `GXWGFifo->T = x`) into a call of re4_gx_put_T(x), in the game's gx.h, the
 * SDK's GXVert.h and __gx.h. The port appends the value, big-endian as the
 * hardware sees it, to the command stream of the emulated graphics processor
 * (or, while a display list is recorded, to the list in memory).
 *
 * The hardware register blocks the GX library reads and writes (CP, PE, PI,
 * MEM) are port memory (re4_gx_register_block, patch 0030 in GXInit.c). */
