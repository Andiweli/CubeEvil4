 * When the touch controls show (TouchControls), by the menu's setting "Touch Controls" (decision
 * of the project owner, 21.10.2026):
 * <ul>
 * <li>AUTO (the default): while no controller is connected; with one, after a tap on the screen
 * until the controller's next button or stick (variant A of 21.10.2026: a Redmi 15 5G reported a
 * controller nobody had connected, the controls stayed hidden and with them the menu).</li>
 * <li>FORCE: always (until 21.10.2026 the switch "Use Touch Controls").</li>
 * <li>SUPPRESS: not while a controller is connected, a tap does not bring them back (taking
 * screenshots with a controller in the hand). Without any controller they show, and a tap shows
 * them as long as no controller was used since the app started: a device that only reports a
 * controller must not leave the player without any way to play or to open the menu.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Pure Java (tests/TouchShowRuleTests.java).
