// The GX renderer of the core mode: executes the chunks the game core's
// emulated graphics processor decodes (port/whole/runtime/re4_gx_frame.h)
// with GLES 3.0. Plan: port/docs/gx-plan.md, step G3.
//
// It keeps the register state the chunks change (BP, XF, the palette part of
// TMEM), draws into its own embedded frame buffer (EFB, 640x528 like the
// GameCube's, colour and depth), turns EFB copies into textures (GXCopyTex)
// and display copies into the picture to show (GXCopyDisp, the XFB). Shaders
// are generated from the state that shapes them (vertex: XF transform,
// lighting channels, texture coordinate generation; fragment: TEV stages,
// alpha test, fog) and cached.
//
// Orientation: the EFB keeps GameCube rows (row 0 = top) at GL row 0, so
// copies, scissor and viewport need no flips; a display shows the XFB upside
// down in GL terms (Present flips it).
