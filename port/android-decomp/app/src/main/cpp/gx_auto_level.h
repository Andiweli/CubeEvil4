// Auto in the app menu's resolution (wish of the project owner, 23.10.2026): the EFB level follows
// the GPU. It starts at the screen's level (one below the level whose 336 rows come closest to the
// screen's rows, CoreMenu.autoScale) and never goes above it.
//
// Every window of at least 2 s and 20 game pictures: fewer than 28.5 pictures a second while the
// GPU is behind (the fence after every chunk, GxStats::behind*: on average at least half a chunk
// not finished) takes one level down. A game that is slow on its own (the processor, loading) leaves
// the GPU idle and the level as it is. Up again one level after 5 windows in a row (10 s) at 29.5
// pictures a second or more with the GPU keeping up (under 0.1 behind), at the earliest 30 s after
// the last step down; down again within 15 s of a step up doubles that wait (at most 5 minutes).
// core_mode.cpp applies a new level between two Runs (GxRenderer::Rescale).
